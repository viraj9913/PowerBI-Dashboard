1. Data Collection & Manipulation: After collection of data from ONS, few cleaning steps were involved. It was observed that few irrelevant rows were present and error values. Therefore, removing such rows using Power BI query editor mode was utilized. On the other hand, Python was also implemented to drop certain data. Using both the tools has offered to compare and gain imporatnce of each tool. As a result, both the tools are effective for handling the data, however Power BI provides flexibility in creating measure in query editor mode, unpivot columns, replacing values at one place.
